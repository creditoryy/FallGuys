# Migration Complete! ✅

## What Changed?

Your FallGuys project has been reorganized into a professional GitHub repository structure that clearly separates:

1. **Wearable Sensor Module** (ESP32 #1 - Windows) - Your current work
2. **Communication Hub** (ESP32 #2 + BeagleBoard - Linux) - Future work

## New Project Structure

```
FallGuys/
├── README.md                          # Main project overview
├── wearable-sensor-module/           # ✅ Your Windows ESP32 work
│   ├── platformio.ini
│   ├── build.bat
│   ├── src/main.cpp
│   └── hal/                          # All your HAL code
├── communication-hub/                # 🚧 Future Linux work
│   ├── esp32/                        # ESP32 #2 firmware

```

## 🚀 What You Need to Do Now

### 1. Update Your Workflow

**OLD WAY** (before):
```cmd
cd FallGuys
build.bat
```

**NEW WAY** (now):
```cmd
cd FallGuys\wearable-sensor-module
build.bat
```

### 2. Open Workspace in VS Code

You should now open the **wearable-sensor-module** folder as your workspace:
```
File → Open Folder → wearable-sensor-module
```

This will give you proper PlatformIO integration for that module.

### 3. Your Files Are Here

All your existing work has been moved:
- ✅ `src/main.cpp` → `wearable-sensor-module/src/main.cpp`
- ✅ `hal/` → `wearable-sensor-module/hal/`
- ✅ `platformio.ini` → `wearable-sensor-module/platformio.ini`
- ✅ `build.bat` → `wearable-sensor-module/build.bat`

### 4. Build and Test

```cmd
cd wearable-sensor-module
build.bat          # Verify it still builds
build.bat upload   # Upload to your ESP32
build.bat monitor  # Check serial output
```

## 📋 What's New?

### 1. Professional Documentation

- **Main README.md**: Complete project overview with all features, timeline, hardware specs
- **wearable-sensor-module/README.md**: Detailed documentation for your module
- **communication-hub/README.md**: Specification for the Linux/BeagleBoard work
- **protocol/README.md**: Complete communication protocol specification
- **docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md**: Quick reference for the entire project

### 2. Communication Protocol Defined

A complete binary protocol (`protocol/protocol.h`) is now defined for communication between:
- Wearable Module → Hub
- Hub → Wearable Module

Packet types include:
- SENSOR_DATA (accelerometer, gyroscope, temp)
- FALL_DETECTED (fall alerts)
- HEARTRATE (vital signs)
- ACK, CONFIG, STATUS, USER_RESPONSE

### 3. Clear Separation

- **Windows Team**: Work in `wearable-sensor-module/` (that's you!)
- **Linux Team**: Work in `communication-hub/` (your teammates)
- **Shared**: `protocol/` for communication standard

## 🎯 Next Steps for Your Work

### Immediate (Continue MS1)

1. **Test Current Code**
   ```cmd
   cd wearable-sensor-module
   build.bat upload monitor
   ```

2. **Add Heart Rate Sensor** (when ready)
   - Create `hal/include/hal/heartrate.h`
   - Implement `hal/src/heartrate.cpp`
   - Update `src/main.cpp`

3. **Implement Protocol** (for communication)
   - Include `../../protocol/protocol.h`
   - Create sensor data packets
   - Send via UART to hub

### MS2 (Integration)

1. **Implement OLED States**
   - Display: "Monitoring", "Fall Suspected", "Emergency"
   - Show user prompt: "Are you OK?"

2. **Communication with Hub**
   - Send sensor data packets
   - Receive ACK from hub
   - Handle CONFIG updates

3. **Testing**
   - Use scripts in `testing/`
   - Calibrate sensors
   - Test fall detection

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Run these commands to verify everything works:

```cmd
# Navigate to wearable module
cd wearable-sensor-module

# Check files exist
dir src\main.cpp
dir hal\include\hal\mpu6050.h
dir hal\src\mpu6050.cpp
dir platformio.ini
dir build.bat

# Try building
build.bat

# If you have ESP32 connected
build.bat upload monitor
```

## 🤝 Team Collaboration

### Git Workflow

```bash
# Windows team works here
git add wearable-sensor-module/
git commit -m "Add heart rate sensor to wearable module"

# Linux team works here
git add communication-hub/
git commit -m "Implement ESP32 communication firmware"

# Both teams update protocol
git add protocol/
git commit -m "Add new packet type for battery status"
```

### Branches

Consider creating branches:
- `main` - stable releases
- `wearable-dev` - wearable module development
- `hub-dev` - communication hub development

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Can't Find Files?
All your files are in `wearable-sensor-module/`

### Build Not Working?
Make sure you're in the correct directory:
```cmd
cd wearable-sensor-module
build.bat
```

### PlatformIO Issues?
Open the `wearable-sensor-module` folder as your workspace in VS Code.

## 📞 Questions?

Refer to:
1. `README.md` - Project overview
2. `wearable-sensor-module/README.md` - Your module
3. `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Structure guide
4. `protocol/README.md` - Communication protocol
