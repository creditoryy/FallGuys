# Testing Directory

This directory contains test scripts and validation tools for the FallGuys system.

## Structure

```
testing/
├── sensor-calibration/      # Sensor calibration tests
├── fall-detection-tests/    # Fall detection algorithm validation
└── integration-tests/       # End-to-end system tests
```

## Status: To Be Developed

Test scripts will be created during MS1-MS2.

## Planned Tests

### Sensor Calibration
- MPU-6050 accuracy verification
- Heart rate sensor calibration
- Cross-reference with professional equipment

### Fall Detection
- Simulated fall scenarios
- False positive testing (jumping, sitting, etc.)
- Threshold tuning
- Algorithm validation

### Integration Tests
- Wearable ↔ Hub communication
- End-to-end fall detection flow
- Emergency response sequence
- GPS location accuracy
- Battery life testing
